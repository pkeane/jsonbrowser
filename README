JSONBrowser is a rudimentary implementation of a browser for linked JSON
data. It is not very useful in itself (just a proof of concept), but may
provide food for thought about what a more sophisticated JSON browser
may do.  The idea here is more akin to a Feed Reader (for RSS/Atom) than
a full-fledged HTML-based web browser.  That said, support for images,
audio, and video would be useful.

While this is written in Python/Tk, a more useful version could be written
for mobile platforms such as Android or iPhone.  The advantage it gives
over an HTML browser is that it is much lighterweight.  Also, it's geared
towards more of a data-centric (rather than text-centric) experience.
